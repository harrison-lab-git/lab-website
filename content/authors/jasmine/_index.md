Jasmine earned her B.S. in Biology from Northeastern University in Boston in 2015 where she first became interested in immunology research while studying germinal center metabolism. She obtained her doctoral degree in Immunology from the University of California, Davis, where she examined memory T cell responses to genital Chlamydia infection in pursuit of understanding the memory CD4 T cell subsets involved in protective immunity. Jasmine is interested in understanding how diversity is maintained within the commensal-specific lymphocyte pool and how commensal-specific immune responses may contribute to tissue repair and pathogen clearance. During her free time, Jasmine enjoys exploring new restaurants, spending time with friends, and taking in the great outdoors.
