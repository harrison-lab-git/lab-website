Sheenam earned her M.Sc. degree in Biotechnology from Punjab Agricultural University and Ph.D. in Structural Immunology under the direction of Dr. Dinakar M. Salunke from the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, India. Her Ph.D. research focused on understanding the molecular basis of antibody promiscuity and its implications in the immune response. Sheenam is particularly interested in studying commensal specific B cells and their contribution to homeostatic immunity. When not working, she likes to explore the Pacific Northwest and trying her hand at cooking.
