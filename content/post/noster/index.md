**Dr. Oliver Harrison at Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason (BRI) has been awarded the Grand Prize in the inaugural NOSTER Science Microbiome competition.**

The NOSTER Science Microbiome Prize has been established to reward innovative research by young investigators working on the functional attributes of the microbiota of any organism that has potential to contribute to our understanding of human or veterinary health and disease or to guide therapeutic interventions.

Grand Prize winner receives:
Each Grand Prize winner will be awarded a cash prize in the amount of US$25,000 and travel and accommodation for the prize ceremony. The Grand Prize winner will also receive a free five (5) year digital subscription to Science, and will have their winning essay published in Science (print and online).
